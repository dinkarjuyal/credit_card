The design of efficient fraud detection algorithms is key for reducing credit card fraud, and more and more algorithms rely on advanced machine learning techniques for this reason.
Given a dataset containing 30 attributes of 284,807 credit card transactions, we have to define a classification algorithm which can identify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
